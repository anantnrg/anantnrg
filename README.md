<h1 align=center>Hey, I'm Anant</h1>
<h3 align=center>I'm a 14yo  :robot: Robotics Developer and a  :crab: Rust programmer</h3>



## About me 
I'm a 14 year old robotics developer and a avid programmer. I love coding in low level system languages like Rust, C/C++ and Python because they're challenging and fun to use! I also love making robots such as quadrupeds and robotic arms.

I learned coding when I was 6. My first language was Python. Then I moved on to C/C++ and now I'm learning Rust. Other than programming, I love skating, mountain biking and Muay Thai.

## My public repos
* [Arduino Basics](https://github.com/anantnrg/Arduino-Basics) - This repository contains all the code needed to get started with Arduino programming.

* [Strata](https://github.com/stratawm/stratawm) - Strata is a modular, dynamic and sleek Wayland compositor for GNU/Linux written completely in Rust

* [Kagi](https://github.com/stratawm/kagi) - Kagi is a hotkey daemon for Strata

## My private repos
Well, if I told you about them, it kinda defeats the whole private repos thing :)
